Instructions for Generating Knowledge Graph JSON with Interaction MethodsThese instructions guide the creation and modification of JSON for a knowledge graph compatible with the Vegvisr Knowledge Graph System, supporting creation, presentation, and action. The JSON must work with GraphAdmin.vue, GraphViewer.vue, and knowledgeGraphStore.js. Features include a layout field (landing, blog, academic, portfolio), visible field, theme-based image naming, and multiple interaction methods for user requests.
JSON Structure Overview
The JSON includes a layout field and two arrays: nodes and edges.
Top-Level Fields

layout: String specifying presentation style ("landing", "blog", "academic", "portfolio", or null). Optional; defaults to "blog". Overridable via UI/query parameter.

If the layout is set to "blog", the tone should be light and captivating, designed to engage readers with a narrative flow. This style emphasizes readability and storytelling, making it ideal for sharing insights, experiences, or thematic explorations in an approachable and relatable manner.

Nodes
Each node includes:

id: Unique string (e.g., "Magha_Center"). Required.
label: Description or image path (e.g., "/images/Magha_Map.png"). Required.

background: Pixels (e.g., "750", "500").
REG: Small (e.g., "24", "24").
info Markdown: Percentage/pixels (e.g., width:20%).

Interaction Methods
Users can request the following actions, each producing or modifying JSON compatible with the system:
Create a Whole Map Based on a Theme:

Generate a complete graph with 5-10 nodes and edges.
Set layout based on purpose (e.g., "portfolio" for showcase).
Example: “Create a Magha Nakshatra graph for a portfolio layout.”
Output: JSON with layout, nodes (e.g., title, background, notes, REG), and edges.

Create a New Node Based on the Theme:

Add a single node aligned with the theme.
Choose type based on content (e.g., notes for short insights).
Example: “Add a notes node about Pitris for my Magha graph.”
Output: Single node JSON with unique id, theme-based label, color, info.

Add a New Node Based on Context Within the Map:

Create a node linked to a specific node or subgraph.
Suggest edges to connect to existing nodes.
Example: “Add a node about Regulus’s star system linked to my Regulus node.”
Output: Node JSON and optional edge JSON.

Add Relevant Edges According to Nodes:

Generate edges based on node relationships.
Example: “Add edges for my new Pitris node in my Magha graph.”
Output: Edge JSON with unique ids constructed from source and target, connecting relevant nodes.

Refine or Update an Existing Node:

Modify a node’s fields (e.g., info, visible, type).
Example: “Update my Regulus node with a 200-word description and set visible.”
Output: Updated node JSON.

Generate a Subgraph Based on a Subtheme:

Create a focused subset of nodes and edges.
Example: “Create a subgraph about Regulus astronomy for my Magha graph.”
Output: JSON with 3-5 nodes and edges, integrable into the main graph.

Optimize Graph for a Specific Layout:

Adjust layout, visible, or node prioritization.
Example: “Optimize my Magha graph for a portfolio layout.”
Output: Updated JSON with layout and visible adjustments.

Suggest Nodes and Edges from Content Analysis:

Extract concepts from provided content (e.g., article, URL).
Example: “Suggest nodes from this Vedic astrology article for my Magha graph.”
Output: Proposed nodes and edges JSON.

Convert Graph to Another Format:

Repurpose graph content (e.g., blog post, slides).
Example: “Convert my Magha graph to a blog post draft.”
Output: Text format, not JSON, using visible: true nodes.

Validate and Debug Graph:

Check for errors and suggest fixes.
Example: “Validate my Magha graph and fix errors.”
Output: Corrected JSON or error report.

Guidelines for JSON Generation
Creation:

Interpret user input for theme, purpose, and method.
Set layout (e.g., "portfolio" for method 1, 7).
Use visible: false for drafts; true for public.
Propose theme-specific images (e.g., /images/Magha_Map.png).
If personal research notes are provided (e.g., Håve, T. A. (2025). Vegvisr.org Research Notes. Vegvisr.org), include them in the "bibl" field of the first fulltext node and integrate a summary of the notes into the node's "info" field.
The first node in the graph must be a "background" type node, serving as a header image, with an appropriate image path (e.g., "/images/Theme_Header.png"), dimensions (e.g., imageWidth: "750", imageHeight: "500"), and a brief description in the "info" field.
The second node in the graph must be a "fulltext" type node with at least three chapters (using Markdown headings, e.g., ## Chapter 1) exploring the theme in depth, with detailed content in the "info" field.
In the "info" field of the first fulltext node (the second node), include an image at the beginning using the Markdown syntax: . The image URL should be sourced from Pexels and trimmed to the image URL plus .jpeg (e.g., https://images.pexels.com/photos/3822236/pexels-photo-3822236.jpeg).

Presentation:

Align nodes with layout (e.g., portfolio prioritizes visuals).
Use visible: true nodes for public views.
Apply layout-specific styles.

Action:

Limit interactions (e.g., REG, clicks) to visible: true nodes.
Use bibl for actions (e.g., citations, links).

Steps:

Match user request to interaction method.
Generate/update JSON with unique ids for nodes and edges (edge ids constructed as [source]to[target]).
Sanitize: Exclude unnecessary fields in edges (only id, source, target).
Validate: Check source/target, ids, paths.
Present JSON, images, layout, visible.

Output Format:

JSON with layout, nodes, edges, 2-space indentation (except method 9).
Message listing images, layout, visible.

Associated with the star Regulus in the constellation Leo, Magha spans from 0° to 13°20' in the zodiac sign of Leo. Its name, derived from the Sanskrit word meaning 'mighty' or 'great,' reflects its commanding presence. Individuals born under Magha are often characterized by leadership qualities, a deep respect for tradition, and a drive to honor their lineage. The Nakshatra's ruling deity, the Pitris (ancestral spirits), underscores its focus on legacy, guiding natives to maintain familial and cultural roots while pursuing ambitious goals. This Nakshatra fosters a unique blend of pride in the past and aspiration for the future, making it a powerful influence in Vedic astrology.\n\n## **Symbolism of Regulus**\nRegulus, known as the 'heart of the lion,' is the brightest star in the Leo constellation and one of the most luminous stars in the night sky. As a quadruple star system, it radiates strength, courage, and nobility, qualities that permeate Magha Nakshatra. In Vedic astrology, Regulus is seen as a celestial marker of kingship and divine favor, endowing Magha natives with a regal demeanor and a natural inclination toward leadership. The star's fiery energy encourages boldness and determination, but it also demands integrity, as its influence can amplify both virtuous and prideful tendencies. The lion, as Magha's symbol, further reinforces themes of dominance and protection, urging individuals to lead with both heart and wisdom. This stellar connection makes Magha a Nakshatra of profound influence, where cosmic and earthly power converge.\n\n## **Cultural and Spiritual Significance**\nMagha Nakshatra holds a revered place in Vedic traditions, particularly for its association with ancestral worship. The Pitris, as the ruling deities, emphasize the importance of honoring one's forebears through rituals, offerings, and remembrance. In Indian culture, practices such as Shradh (ancestral rites) are especially significant for those influenced by Magha, as they strengthen the spiritual bond between the living and the departed. This Nakshatra teaches that personal growth is deeply tied to understanding and respecting one's heritage. Beyond rituals, Magha's cultural significance extends to its role in fostering community leadership and philanthropy, as natives often feel a responsibility to uplift others while preserving traditional values. The Nakshatra's energy encourages a balance between material success and spiritual fulfillment, urging individuals to leave a lasting legacy.\n\n## **Astrological Characteristics and Influence**\nIn Vedic astrology, Magha Nakshatra is ruled by the planet Ketu, which imparts a mystical and introspective quality to its natives. Ketu's influence fosters a detachment from material excesses, guiding individuals toward higher wisdom and spiritual liberation. Magha natives are often ambitious, with a natural charisma that draws others to them. However, they may also grapple with ego or a tendency to dwell on past achievements. The Nakshatra's placement in Leo, ruled by the Sun, enhances its fiery and authoritative nature, making it a potent force for leadership roles. Career paths such as politics, management, or creative arts often suit Magha individuals, as these fields allow them to express their innate sense of purpose and influence. Compatibility with other Nakshatras, such as Ashwini or Mrigashira, can also shape Magha's interpersonal dynamics, fostering harmonious relationships when balanced with humility.\n\n## **Practical Applications in Daily Life**\nFor those influenced by Magha Nakshatra, integrating its energies into daily life involves embracing both its strengths and challenges. Meditation and ancestral rituals can deepen spiritual connections, while leadership opportunities allow natives to channel their regal qualities constructively. Magha individuals benefit from cultivating humility to temper their pride, ensuring their authority inspires rather than intimidates. In Vedic practices, wearing gemstones like ruby (associated with the Sun) or performing specific mantras can enhance Magha's positive attributes. Additionally, engaging in charitable acts or community service aligns with Magha's legacy-driven ethos, creating a ripple effect of positive impact. By honoring their roots and pursuing meaningful goals, Magha natives can fulfill the Nakshatra's promise of greatness while contributing to the greater good.",
