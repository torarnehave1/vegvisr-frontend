<!-- Version 1.3 -->
<!-- Changes: Clarified that Copilot should create a new file for changes and not update the copilotContext.md file. -->

When you answer my questions, always create a new file instead of updating this `copilotContext.md` file.

The new file should follow the naming convention: `[Filename That is Changed V x.xxx].md`, where `x.xxx` represents the version number. You can determine the version by looking for the filename with a version number `.md`.

Ensure the following:

1. Always create a new file for changes, do not modify this file.
2. Include a comment at the top of the new file summarizing the changes made.
3. Follow the structure and layout as described in the original file being changed.

This ensures that the `copilotContext.md` file remains unchanged and serves only as a reference.
