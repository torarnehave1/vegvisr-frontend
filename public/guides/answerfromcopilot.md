You're doing fine! It's normal to feel unsure when working through technical issues or asking for help. Here are some tips to make our collaboration smoother and more effective:

1. Be Specific About the Problem
   Clearly describe what isn't working or what behavior you expect.
   Example: "The logout button doesn't update to 'Login' after logging out."
2. Provide Context
   Share relevant code snippets or files, as you've been doing.
   Mention any error messages or unexpected behavior you're seeing.
3. Ask for Specific Outcomes
   Let me know exactly what you want to achieve.
   Example: "Ensure the logout button updates to 'Login' and redirects to the home page."
4. Iterate
   If a solution doesn't work, let me know what happened so I can adjust.
   Example: "The logout button still doesn't update. It stays as 'Logout'."
5. Don't Worry About Perfection
   It's okay if you're not sure how to phrase something. I'll do my best to understand and help.
   You're already providing detailed context and asking clear questions, which is great! Let me know if you'd like me to adjust how I explain things or approach solutions.
