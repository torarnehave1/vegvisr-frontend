System Context Diagram: Offers a high-level overview of the software system, illustrating its interactions with external entities like users and other systems.​

Container Diagram: Delves deeper to show the internal containers (applications, databases, services) that make up the system and how they communicate.​

Component Diagram: Further decomposes each container to reveal the components (modules, libraries) within and their interactions.​

Code Diagram: Provides detailed insights into the code structure, such as classes and interfaces, within a component.​

By utilizing these diagrams, the C4 Model facilitates effective communication among technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring a shared understanding of the system's design and architecture.
