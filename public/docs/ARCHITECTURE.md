### Router

Vegvisr.org uses Vue Router to manage navigation and page transitions throughout the single-page application. The router configuration includes:

- **Named Routes:** Each major view (Home, Blog, GraphAdmin, GraphViewer, Portfolio, Registration, Login, etc.) is mapped to a named route for easy navigation and programmatic access.
- **Dynamic and Fallback Routes:** Supports dynamic paths (e.g., `/graph-viewer?graphId=...`) and a catch-all route for 404 handling.
- **Authentication Guards:** Routes can require authentication via `meta.requiresAuth`. The router checks user state (via Pinia store) and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.
- **Layout Selection:** Some routes (e.g., registration, editor, sound studio) dynamically select between embedded and default layouts based on query parameters.
- **Props Passing:** Query parameters (such as `graphId` or `theme`) are passed as props to views for flexible, context-aware rendering.

This routing system ensures a secure, flexible, and user-friendly navigation experience, supporting both public and authenticated workflows, as well as embedded and standalone modes.

_This chapter gives a high-level description of each major component and its role in the Vegvisr.org system._
