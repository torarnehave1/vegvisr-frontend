Vegvisr.org is an open-source framework for mystical navigation, organizational transformation, and collective ritual.
Built with Vue.js + Cloudflare and inspired by the Vegvísir compass, we’re creating tools like a digital compass, knowledge map, and sound studio for mantra, phonetics, and symbolic alignment.

We’re a growing collective of developers, artists, philosophers, and researchers working across code, etymology, esoterica, and community design.
Join us to co-create an evolving system rooted in sacred language, decentralized wisdom, and ritual collaboration.
