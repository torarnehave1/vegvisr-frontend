# 🗺️ Production KML Image Debugging Guide

## Test Setup

### 1. **Create Map Node in GNewViewer**
- Go to your production GNewViewer
- Create a new map node or edit existing one
- Set KML path to: `https://klm.vegvisr.org/Glunka%20(1).kml`
- Save the node

### 2. **Open Browser Console**
- Press F12 or right-click → Inspect
- Go to Console tab
- Clear console for clean output

### 3. **Load the Map**
- Navigate to the map node in GNewViewer
- Watch console output for debugging messages

## Expected Console Output

### ✅ **Successful KML Loading**
```
🗺️ Loading KML from: https://klm.vegvisr.org/Glunka%20(1).kml
📄 KML content loaded, length: [some number]
🗺️ Found [number] placemarks in KML
🏷️ First placemark name: [name]
📦 First placemark has carousel: true/false
```

### 🔍 **Image Detection Process**
For each placemark with images:
```
🔍 Checking placemark for images: Start og Slutt
📦 Found carousel: true
🖼️ Found gx:Image: true
🔗 Found imageUrl: https://earth.usercontent.google.com/...
✨ Clean imageUrl: https://earth.usercontent.google.com/...
```

### 🖼️ **Image Loading Results**
When you click on markers:
```
✅ Image loaded successfully
OR
❌ Image failed to load
```

## Troubleshooting

### **No Placemarks Found**
- KML file might not be loading
- Check network tab for KML fetch errors
- Verify KML URL is accessible

### **Placemark Found But No Carousel**
- The placemark doesn't have gx:Carousel element
- Try clicking different markers
- "Start og Slutt" marker should have the image

### **Carousel Found But No Image URL**
- gx:Image element might be missing
- gx:imageUrl content might be empty
- Check KML file structure

### **Image URL Found But Load Fails**
- CORS issues with Google Earth image servers
- Image URL might be malformed
- Network restrictions

## Quick Actions

### **Test Specific Marker**
1. Look for "Start og Slutt" marker on the map
2. Click on it to open info window
3. Check if image appears in popup
4. Watch console for load success/failure

### **Alternative Testing**
If the main KML doesn't work, try with a simpler test:
- Create a KML with local images
- Test with publicly accessible image URLs
- Verify Google Maps API permissions

## Next Steps

Based on console output, we can:
- Fix KML parsing issues
- Handle CORS problems
- Adjust image URL processing
- Improve error handling

Remember to check both the Console and Network tabs in developer tools!
