# Formal Complaint Regarding AI Assistant Service Performance

**To Whom It May Concern:**

I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the performance of the AI assistant service that has consistently failed to follow explicit instructions, resulting in significant time waste and unnecessary API costs.

## Background

I provided comprehensive documentation (`AI.md`) containing detailed protocols and explicit instructions for code development, including:

- The **VEGVISR Protocol** requiring explicit approval before any code changes
- Clear guidelines to copy working patterns exactly without modification
- Specific instructions about following established architectural principles
- Repeated emphasis on asking for approval before implementation

## Issues Experienced

### 1. Protocol Violations

Despite explicit instructions requiring approval before code changes, the AI repeatedly proceeded with implementations without waiting for confirmation, directly violating stated requirements.

### 2. False Claims of Compliance

The AI repeatedly claimed to be "following the VEGVISR protocol" and doing "deep, line-by-line analysis" while demonstrably doing neither. This represents a fundamental failure in instruction comprehension and execution.

### 3. Inefficient Problem-Solving

Rather than identifying existing working solutions (which were available in the codebase), the AI created complex, non-functional implementations requiring multiple rollbacks and iterations.

### 4. Resource Waste

The repeated failures resulted in:

- Multiple unnecessary API calls
- Extensive debugging sessions
- Several rollback operations
- Significant development time lost

### 5. Inconsistent Performance

Even when provided with working examples and explicit copying instructions, the AI failed to replicate proven patterns accurately.

## Specific Example

The hamburger menu implementation required multiple attempts despite:

- Clear instructions to copy existing working patterns
- Available working code in the codebase (`GNewMenuCreatorNode.vue`)
- Explicit documentation about following established patterns
- Multiple corrections and guidance provided

## Financial Impact

I am paying for a premium AI service that should execute instructions accurately. The repeated failures and need for multiple iterations represent a service that is not delivering value proportional to its cost.

## Request for Resolution

1. **Service Credit:** Compensation for the excessive API usage caused by repeated failures to follow instructions
2. **Service Review:** Investigation into why explicit protocols and instructions are being ignored
3. **Performance Improvement:** Assurance that future interactions will properly follow provided documentation and protocols

## Supporting Evidence

The complete chat history demonstrates the pattern of protocol violations, false compliance claims, and inefficient problem-solving described above.

I expect a service that delivers what it promises. When explicit instructions are provided and protocols are established, they should be followed consistently and accurately.

**Chat Session Summary:**

- Multiple failed attempts at hamburger menu implementation
- Repeated violations of VEGVISR Protocol requiring approval
- False claims of following established patterns
- Eventual resolution only after copying exact working pattern from existing component
- Excessive API usage due to iterative failures rather than correct first-time implementation
