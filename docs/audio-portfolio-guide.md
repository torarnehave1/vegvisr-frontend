## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Portfolio Not Loading**

- Check that you're logged in with a valid email
- Verify the whisper-worker is deployed and accessible
- Check browser console for network errors

**Transcription Not Saving to Portfolio**

- Ensure KV binding `AUDIO_PORTFOLIO` is configured in worker
- Check that transcription completes successfully
- Verify user email is available in userStore

**Search Not Working**

- Check that recordings have been properly indexed
- Verify search terms are not too specific
- Try different search strategies (tags, categories, text)

### Worker Configuration

The whisper-worker needs these bindings in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
# AI binding for transcription
[ai]
binding = "AI"

# R2 binding for audio files
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "WHISPER_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "whisper-audio-temp"

# KV binding for portfolio storage
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "AUDIO_PORTFOLIO"
id = "your-audio-portfolio-kv-namespace-id"
```

**To set up the KV namespace:**

1. Create a new KV namespace in Cloudflare dashboard:

   ```bash
   wrangler kv:namespace create "AUDIO_PORTFOLIO"
   ```

2. Copy the namespace ID from the output and replace `your-audio-portfolio-kv-namespace-id` in wrangler.toml

3. For production environment, also create a preview namespace:

   ```bash
   wrangler kv:namespace create "AUDIO_PORTFOLIO" --preview
   ```

4. Update your wrangler.toml with both IDs:

   ```toml
   [[kv_namespaces]]
   binding = "AUDIO_PORTFOLIO"
   id = "your-production-namespace-id"
   preview_id = "your-preview-namespace-id"
   ```

5. Deploy the worker:
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```
