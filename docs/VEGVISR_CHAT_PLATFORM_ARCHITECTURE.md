class ChatRoom {
  constructor(controller, env) {
    this.controller = controller
    this.env = env
    this.sessions = new Map()
    this.messages = []
  }

  async fetch(request) {

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Message analysis and enhancement
    // Smart reply suggestions
    // Content summarization
    // Translation services

    // Community moderation
    // Governance voting
    // Analytics and reporting
  },
}
```

  },
}
```

#### 3. Data Layer Architecture

**D1 Database Schema**

```sql
-- Chat-specific tables
CREATE TABLE chat_rooms (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  community_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  settings JSON
);

CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  room_id TEXT,
  user_id TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  message_type TEXT, -- text, image, graph, file
  metadata JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (room_id) REFERENCES chat_rooms(id)
);

CREATE TABLE chat_members (
  room_id TEXT,
  user_id TEXT,
  role TEXT, -- member, moderator, admin
  joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (room_id, user_id)
);

-- Integration with existing user system
-- References existing users, knowledge_graphs, etc.
```

**KV Store Structure**

```javascript
// Real-time state management
{
  "chat:room:{room_id}:online": ["user1", "user2", ...],
  "chat:user:{user_id}:presence": {
    "status": "online",
    "last_seen": "2024-12-20T10:30:00Z",
    "current_room": "room_id"
  },
  "chat:room:{room_id}:typing": ["user1", "user2", ...],
  "chat:community:{community_id}:config": {
    "branding": {...},
    "features": [...],
    "moderation": {...}
  }
}
```

**R2 Storage Organization**

```
/chat-media/
├── images/
│   ├── {room_id}/
│   └── {message_id}/
├── files/
│   ├── documents/
│   └── audio/
└── avatars/
    └── {user_id}/
```

### Repository Strategy

**Separate Repository with Submodule Integration**

```
vegvisr-frontend/
├── src/
├── api-worker/
├── vegvisr-chat/          # Git submodule pointing to separate repo
│   ├── chat-frontend/     # Vue.js chat components
│   ├── chat-worker/       # Durable Objects chat worker
│   ├── ai-chat-worker/    # AI integration worker
│   ├── community-worker/  # Community management worker
│   ├── knowledge-bridge-worker/ # Knowledge graph integration
│   ├── deployment/        # Wrangler configs and CI/CD
│   └── README.md
└── package.json
```

**Benefits of This Structure**

- Independent development and deployment
- Separate open-source licensing if desired
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to extract for other communities
- Maintains integration with main platform

### Domain Strategy

**Subdomain Architecture**

- `chat.vegvisr.org` - Main chat platform
- `chat.{community}.vegvisr.org` - Community-specific instances
- `{custom-domain}` - White-label community deployments

**Routing Strategy**

```javascript
// Community-specific routing
const communityConfig = await env.KV.get(`community:${domain}:config`)
if (communityConfig) {
  // Route to community-specific chat instance
  // Apply community branding and settings
  // Filter content based on community rules
}
```
