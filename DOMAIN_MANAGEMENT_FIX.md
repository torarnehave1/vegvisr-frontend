# Domain Management Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The "Failed to fetch" error in the Superadmin Domain Management interface was caused by incorrect KV binding references in the API worker.

## Root Cause
The `handleAdminDomains` function and other domain-related functions were using a placeholder `BINDING_NAME` instead of the actual `SITE_CONFIGS` KV binding name.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed handleAdminDomains Function
- Changed `env.BINDING_NAME.list()` to `env.SITE_CONFIGS.list()`
- Changed `env.BINDING_NAME.get()` to `env.SITE_CONFIGS.get()`
- Added proper error handling for missing SITE_CONFIGS binding

### 2. Fixed handleTransferDomain Function
- Updated KV get/put operations to use `env.SITE_CONFIGS`
- Maintains compatibility with existing site configuration structure

### 3. Fixed handleShareTemplate Function
- Updated template sharing to use `env.SITE_CONFIGS` for site configuration data
- Preserves template creation and management functionality

### 4. Fixed handleRemoveDomain Function
- Updated domain removal to use `env.SITE_CONFIGS`
- Ensures proper cleanup of domain configuration data

## Remaining Issues

### BINDING_NAME References Still Need Configuration
There are still references to `env.BINDING_NAME` in the following areas:
- General graph/markdown content storage (vis:, hid: prefixes)
- Sandbox operations (sandbox: prefix)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Configure KV Bindings**: Update the wrangler.toml file for the api-worker to include proper KV namespace bindings
2. **Replace BINDING_NAME**: Either create a main KV binding for general content or use existing bindings appropriately
3. **Test Domain Management**: The domain management interface should now work correctly

## Files Modified
- `api-worker/index.js` - Fixed KV binding references in domain management functions

## Expected Result
The Superadmin Domain Management interface should now be able to:
- Load domain lists successfully
- Transfer domains between users
- Share templates between domains
- Remove domains from the system

The "Failed to fetch" error should be resolved for the domain management functionality.
