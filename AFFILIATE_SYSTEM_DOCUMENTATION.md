## Implementation Details

### 1. Worker Bindings Configuration

```

  'affiliate_registration_invitation',
  'Affiliate Registration Invitation',
  '{
    "subject": "Join {{siteName}} as an Affiliate Partner! ðŸš€",
    "html": "...",
    "text": "..."
  }',
  '[
    {"name": "recipientName", "type": "string", "required": true},
    {"name": "senderName", "type": "string", "required": true},
    {"name": "siteName", "type": "string", "required": true},
    {"name": "commissionRate", "type": "string", "required": true},
