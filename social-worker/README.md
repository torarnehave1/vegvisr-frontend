   ```

   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

   **Note**: The social-worker uses the existing `vegvisr_org` database with ID `507d1efd-1dda-45ef-971f-52d2c8e8afe8`, allowing for seamless integration with existing user and graph data while maintaining complete functional isolation.

## Integration with Frontend

The social worker integrates with the frontend through dedicated Vue components:

- `SocialInteractionBar.vue` - Professional engagement buttons
- `NodeCommentSection.vue` - Node-level comment interface
- `FollowButton.vue` - Professional connection management
- `ProfessionalFeed.vue` - Timeline of insights

These components are optional overlays that can be added to existing views without modifying core functionality.

## Rollback Safety

- Independent deployment
- Isolated database
- Optional frontend components
- No dependencies in existing code

## Default Behavior

- All existing graphs get 'hybrid' social features by default
- No changes required to existing knowledge graphs
- Creator can modify engagement levels anytime
- Zero impact on existing graph creation/viewing workflows
